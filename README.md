# Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use Flask-SQLAlchemy to define a data model
- Use SQLAlchemy-Serializer to serialize an object
- Implement a Flask application that queries the database
- Implement a Flask application that returns a JSON response

---

## Setup

Fork and clone the lab repo.

Run `pipenv install` and `pipenv shell` .

```console
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

Change into the `server` directory and configure the `FLASK_APP` and
`FLASK_RUN_PORT` environment variables:

```console
$ cd server
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
```

## Task #1: Define a model

Edit `server/models.py` to add a new model class named `Earthquake` that
inherits from both `db.Model` and `SerializerMixin`.

Add the following attributes to the `Earthquake` model:

- a string named `__tablename__` assigned to the value `"earthquakes"`.
- a column named `id` to store an int that is the primary key.
- a column named `magnitude` to store a float.
- a column named `location` to store a string.
- A column named `year` to store an int.

Add a `__repr__` method to return a string that formats the attributes id,
magnitude, location, and year as a comma-separated sequence as shown:

```text
<Earthquake 1, 9.5, Chile, 1960>
```

Save `server/models.py`. Make sure you are in the `server` directory, then type
the following to test the new `Earthquake` model class:

```console
$ pytest testing/models_test.py
```

The 4 tests should pass. If not, update your `Earthquake` model to pass the
tests before proceeding.

## Task #2: Initialize the database

Now it is time to create a database named `app.db` with a table named
`earthquakes`.

Execute the following commands within the `server` directory:

```console
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
```

The `instance` and `migrations` folder should appear with the database file and
a migration script.

Let's run the migration to create the `earthquakes` table:

```console
flask db upgrade head
```

Take a look at the file `seed.py`:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# server/seed.py

from app import app
from models import db, Earthquake

with app.app_context():

    # Delete all rows in the "earthquakes" table
    Earthquake.query.delete()

    # Add several Earthquake instances to the "earthquakes" table
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=9.5, location="Chile", year=1960))
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=9.2, location="Alaska", year=1964))
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=8.6, location="Alaska", year=1946))
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=8.5, location="Banda Sea", year=1934))
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=8.4, location="Chile", year=1922))

    # Commit the transaction
    db.session.commit()

```

Run the following command within the `server` directory to seed the table:

```console
python seed.py
```

Use the Flask shell to confirm the 5 earthquakes have been added and id's have
been assigned. Your output may differ depending on your implementation of the
`__repr__()` method:

```command
$ flask shell
>>> Earthquake.query.all()
[<Earthquake 1, 9.5, Chile, 1960>, <Earthquake 2, 9.2, Alaska, 1964>, <Earthquake 3, 8.6, Alaska, 1946>, <Earthquake 4, 8.5, Banda Sea, 1934>, <Earthquake 5, 8.4, Chile, 1922>]
```

In the next step, you will implement views to query by id and filter by
magnitude. But first you should practice some Flask-SQLAlchemy functions in the
Flask shell.

Recall the `filter_by()` function selects rows having a specific value for a
column. For example, to select the row matching a specific id `5`:

```console
>>> Earthquake.query.filter_by(id=5).first()
<Earthquake 5, 8.4, Chile, 1922>
```

The `filter()` function selects rows matching a boolean expression. You can also
use it to match a specific id:

```console
>>> Earthquake.query.filter(Earthquake.id==5).first()
<Earthquake 5, 8.4, Chile, 1922>
```

Note that the `filter_by()` function can only test for equality. Use the
`filter()` function if you need to use a different relational operator. For
example, to get all quakes with a magnitude of at least 8.6, you need to use
`filter()` with a boolean expression using the `>=` operator:

```console
>>> Earthquake.query.filter(Earthquake.magnitude >= 8.6).all()
[<Earthquake 1, 9.5, Chile, 1960>, <Earthquake 2, 9.2, Alaska, 1964>, <Earthquake 3, 8.6, Alaska, 1946>]
```

Exit out of Flask shell and move on to the next task.

```console
>>> exit()
```

## Task #3: Add view to get an earthquake by id

Edit `app.py` to add a view that takes one parameter, an integer that represents
an id. The route should have the form `/earthquakes/<int:id>`.

The view should query the database to get the earthquake with that id, and
return a response containing the model attributes and values (id, location,
magnitude, year) formatted as an JSON string. The response should include an
error message if no row is found. Don't forget to import `Earthquake` from the
`models` module.

For example, the URL http://127.0.0.1:5555/earthquakes/2 should result in a
response with a 200 status and a body containing JSON formatted text as shown:

```text
{
  "id": 2,
  "location": "Alaska",
  "magnitude": 9.2,
  "year": 1964
}
```

However, the URL http://127.0.0.1:5555/earthquakes/9999 should result in a
response with a 404 status and a body containing JSON formatted text as shown:

```text
{
  "message": "Earthquake 9999 not found."
}
```

Test the route by typing the following within the `server` directory (make sure
the Flask server is running):

```console
pytest testing/app_earthquake_test.py
```

Make sure the 4 tests pass.

## Task #4: Add view to get earthquakes matching a minimum magnitude value

Edit `app.py` to add a view that takes one parameter, a float that represents an
magnitude. The route should have the form
`/earthquakes/magnitude/<float:magnitude>`.

The view should query the database to get all earthquakes having a magnitude
greater than or equal to the parameter value, and return a JSON response
containing the count of matching rows along with a list containing the data for
each row.

For example, the URL http://127.0.0.1:5555/earthquakes/magnitude/9.0 should
result in a response with a 200 status and a body containing JSON formatted text
as shown:

```text
{
  "count": 2,
  "quakes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "location": "Chile",
      "magnitude": 9.5,
      "year": 1960
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "location": "Alaska",
      "magnitude": 9.2,
      "year": 1964
    }
  ]
}
```

The URL http://127.0.0.1:5555/earthquakes/magnitude/10.0 should result in a
response with a 200 status and a body containing JSON formatted text as shown:

```text
{
  "count": 0,
  "quakes": []
}
```

Test the route by typing the following within the `server` directory:

```console
pytest testing/app_magnitude_test.py
```

Make sure the 3 tests pass.

## Submit your solution

Save all files and rerun all tests:

```console
pytest
```

Once all tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to submit.
